# Teach Access Tutorial

This resource is part of the [Teach Access Initiative](http://teachaccess.org/), and provides best practices for making 
accessible mobile and web apps. You can view the tutorial at <https://teachaccess.github.io/tutorial/>.

This tutorial was built with [exerslide](https://facebookincubator.github.io/exerslide/).

The content is located in `slides/`. You can make changes to the content 
without having to generate the presentation, just by cloning this repository 
and editing the files in `slides/`.

If you want to generate the presentation on your compute, you need to

1. Install exerslide globally. Exerslide is using Node, you can install it via 
   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

   ```
   npm install -g exerslide-cli
   ```

2. Clone this repository

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/teachaccess/tutorial.git
   ```

3. Install the project's dependencies via

   ```
   npm install
   ```

Now you can generate the presentation. `exerslide serve` will start local 
webserver and automatically regenerate the presentation when you update slides.
